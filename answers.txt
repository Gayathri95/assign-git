• What does fast-forward in Git mean? 

         Fast-forward is the process of merging a branch which is ahead of the currently checked out branch thereby fast-forwarding the checked-out branch version.

• Why should you have diﬀerent branches? 

          Different branches help in developing multiple features parallelly without affecting the original master version. Thus, the development work is unhindered, and the work can be merged to the master once completed.


•In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

          Usually the number depends on the number of people working on the project, the dependencies of one project on another and the location of the developers.  Usually there is only one remote git repository. But we can add more repositories if needed.
